**Admission Predictor**

**Description:**

The Admission Predictor is a machine learning-powered web application designed to estimate the chances of admission for students based on academic and personal details. The project features a Flask-based web interface allowing users to input GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP score, LOR score, CGPA, and research experience. The application then utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to provide real-time predictions on the likelihood of admission.

**Key Features:**

1. **Web Interface:** User-friendly web form for inputting academic and personal details.
2. **Predictive Model:** Incorporates a machine learning model trained on historical admission data.
3. **Real-time Predictions:** Users receive instant feedback on their predicted chance of admission.
4. **Interactive and Responsive:** Built using Flask, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

**How to Use:**

1. **Input Information:** Users provide academic and personal information through the web form.
2. **Predictions:** The application processes input data using a pre-trained model to provide an estimated chance of admission.
3. **User-Friendly:** The web interface is designed for easy navigation and a straightforward user experience.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- TensorFlow (or Keras for machine learning)
- HTML and CSS (Frontend)
- Pandas and NumPy (Data processing)
- Seaborn and Matplotlib (Data visualization)

**Purpose:**

The Admission Predictor serves as a tool to assist prospective students in estimating their chances of admission based on historical data patterns. It provides a quick and accessible way for users to receive feedback on their likelihood of acceptance to an educational institution.
